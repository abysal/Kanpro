MongoDB database is NoSQL database having the feature of flexibility and scalability and it can store large volume of data in its collections (tables). In this project the four main methods of restful api are used and they post, put, delete and get. The get method is used for getting/fetching the information/data from database, post method is used for inserting data into the database, put method is used to update documents in database and delete method is used to delete/remove documents in the database through the use of api.
